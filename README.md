# Skedge

## Description
This is a simple scheduling app I made for a project in college. It is a Ruby on Rails app using Rails 6.0.1 and Ruby 2.6.5.


## Example
You can find a live version of the app [here](https://goskedge.herokuapp.com)

## Notes

* Unfortunately, while the app is functional, a key component to adding users to your organization is through a 'magic-link' delivered by email. I don't have the funds to purchase a transactional email service for the demo, so the invitation email will not be delivered.

* Since this was for a school project where no front-end was required, this app will not work (well) on mobile devices.
